Capstone Project

An Open Educational Resource (OER) Learning Management System for Sustainability and Environment Studies

By John Reilly

Project Summary

Although the project focus is to curate a Learning Management System to supplement programs in Sustainability and Environmental Studies, 
the System itself should not be limited to that particular field of study. Rather, the LMS should be developed so its capabilities are 
independent of the content. In this regard, the Capstone can be treated as a demonstration of the LMS for use in other educational 
and professional training applications.
