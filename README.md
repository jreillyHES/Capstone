Capstone Project

An Open Educational Resource (OER) Learning Management System for Sustainability and Environment Studies

By John Reilly

Project Summary

Although the project focus is to curate a Learning Management System to supplement programs in Sustainability and Environmental Studies, 
the System itself should not be limited to that particular field of study. Rather, the LMS should be developed so its capabilities are 
independent of the content. In this regard, the Capstone can be treated as a demonstration of the LMS for use in other educational 
and professional training applications.

With the coronavirus outbreak, many educational institutions were forced to convert entirely to on-line classes in very short order. 
Many of these institutions were ill prepared for this sudden and radical change. This project, then, with its Understandinf by Design approach and 
digital media technology, has been expanded to address this issue as an avenue to help educational institutions to quickly ramp up
an on-line conversion if they need arises in the future.
